# Tuxer-UI
An incredibly lightweight library for the [tuxer](https://github.com/LemmaAlliance/tuxer) browser, designed to provide an easier way to create windows.

## Progress
![](https://geps.dev/progress/30)

Progress has slowed :-(, I am currently writing the script to open the window.
I have written code to connect to X11, send & recieve handshakes. I am yet to verify the handshake, but no errors are thrown.
